# Rinteract

Rinteract makes it easy to output all conditional effects in models with interaction terms instead of computing hypothesis tests manually.

Currently only accepts `lm`, `glm` and `lm_robust` models.

Package is still in early development. To install, use `devtools::install_github("jonfoong/Rinteract")`
