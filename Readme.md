Rinteract makes it easy to output all conditional effects in models with
interaction terms instead of computing hypothesis tests manually.

## Installation

``` r
devtools::install_github("jonfoong/Rinteract")
```

## Overview

Interaction terms are widely used in regression models to uncover
underlying heterogeneity. Despite its ubiquity, the interpretation of
interaction models is often confusing at best and inaccurate at worst.
In addition, studies typically only report estimates from a model output
and neglect their conditional effects. As noted in Brambor et al (2006):

> â€¦the typical results table often conveys very little information of

> standard errors.

Demeaning variables before estimation partly resolves this issue.
However, we may also be interested in effect sizes for specific
conditions beyond just the mean. Consider a hypothetical drug treatment
for which we are also interested in heterogeneity across genders. We
estimate a simple model:

$$Y = \alpha + \beta * Treat + \gamma * Female + \delta * Treat * Female+\epsilon$$

The estimated parameter $\hat{\delta}$ gives us the difference in
treatment effect between male and female patients. However, we are also
interested in the treatment effect conditioning on being a female
patient, which is given by $\hat{\beta} + \hat{\delta}$. While this
simple arithmetic can be performed by looking at a regression table,
standard errors are not so easily obtained.

`Rinteract` facilitates this by computing all conditional effects in a
model with interactions. It accepts a model object as input and relies
on `multcomp` to perform hypothesis testing on all conditions of
interest. It also provides functionality for graphing these effects via
tabular ggplots that can be further manipulated.

## Usage

We use data from the Rand Health Insurance Experiment from the
`sampleSelection` package to illustrate an example. By default,
`int_conditions` takes a fitted model and returns all effects and model
predictions in the 0, 1, and mean condition for all variables.

``` r
data("RandHIE")

mod <- fixest::feols(xghindx~female*linc*xage|year, RandHIE)

dat <- int_conditions(mod, RandHIE,
                      fixef = list(year = factor(unique(RandHIE$year))),
                      .names = c(female = "female",
                                 log_income = "linc",
                                 age = "xage"))

dat |> 
  head(3) |>
  rbind(dat |> tail(3)) |>
  kable(digits = 3)
```

|     | female | log_income | age | estimate | std.error | p.value | value         |
|:----|:-------|:-----------|:----|---------:|----------:|--------:|:--------------|
| 1   | effect | 0          | 0   |   -8.819 |     1.034 |       0 | Causal effect |
| 2   | effect | all        | 0   |   -1.245 |     0.127 |       0 | Causal effect |
| 3   | effect | 1          | 0   |   -7.950 |     0.917 |       0 | Causal effect |
| 62  | 0      | all        | all |   74.000 |        NA |      NA | Level         |
| 63  | 1      | all        | all |   72.551 |        NA |      NA | Level         |
| 64  | all    | all        | all |   73.251 |        NA |      NA | Level         |

From the first row we see that the effect of being a woman, condition on
income and age at zero, is -8.819. Obviously these conditions are of
little analytical value. While `int_conditions` also returns mean
conditions, we can also specify values for our variables to take.

``` r

median_inc <- round(median(RandHIE$linc), 3)

dat <- int_conditions(mod, RandHIE,
                      zero_con = c(xage = 50,
                                   linc = median_inc),
                      fixef = list(year = factor(unique(RandHIE$year))),
                      .names = c(female = "female",
                                 log_income = "linc",
                                 age = "xage"))
dat |> 
  head() |>
  kable(digits = 3)
```

| female | log_income | age | estimate | std.error | p.value | value         |
|:-------|:-----------|:----|---------:|----------:|--------:|:--------------|
| effect | 8.984      | 50  |    4.920 |     0.781 |   0.000 | Causal effect |
| effect | all        | 50  |    4.680 |     0.759 |   0.000 | Causal effect |
| effect | 1          | 50  |   -2.025 |     0.708 |   0.004 | Causal effect |
| effect | 8.984      | all |    2.043 |     0.416 |   0.000 | Causal effect |
| effect | 8.984      | 1   |   -0.886 |     0.132 |   0.000 | Causal effect |
| effect | all        | all |   -1.449 |     0.036 |   0.000 | Causal effect |

We can also visualize these effects using a graph. `int_graph` returns a
tabular ggplot object that displays all conditional effects and model
predictions and can be further manipulated. Highlighted cells correspond
to effect estimates and standard errors and the rest are model
predictions. Values in bold correspond to estimates with p-values
\<0.05.

``` r
dat |>
  transform(log_income = ifelse(log_income==median_inc,
         "median", log_income)) |>
  int_graph(female~log_income+age, digits = 2) +
  ggtitle("All conditional means and effects from a three-way interaction")
```

For scientific publications, we can change the color scheme using a few
simple arguments since the output is a ggplot object.

``` r
dat |>
  transform(log_income = ifelse(log_income==median_inc,
         "median", log_income)) |>
  int_graph(female~log_income+age, 
            digits = 2,
            eff_var = "log_income",
            col_level = "white",
            col_label = "gray80",
            col_values = "black") +
  ggtitle("All conditional means and effects from a three-way interaction") +
  scale_fill_grey(start = 0.9, end = 0.5)
```

Note: Technically, `int_conditions` will work for all models that are
accepted by `multcomp::glht`.`int_graph` also only takes up to four-way
interactions as of yet; for clarity I do not recommended going higher
than this. One way to visualise five or higher way interactions is to
choose up to four variables to plot, and then keep values for all other
variables fixed before feeding into `int_graph`.
