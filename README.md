### Installation

``` r

devtools::install_github("jonfoong/Rinteract")
```

## Overview

Rinteract makes it easy to output all conditional effects in models with
interaction terms instead of computing hypothesis tests manually.

Currently only accepts `lm`, `glm` and `lm_robust` models.
